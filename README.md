# Cyclistic Bike Share Analysis

This repository contains the analysis of bike-share data from the Cyclistic company. The goal of this project is to provide insights into the usage patterns of Cyclistic's bike share system and to identify opportunities to convert casual riders into annual members from Google Data Analytics Capstone. 


## Repository Structure

- The data source: https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html
- `main.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the full analysis workflow, from data preparation to exploratory data analysis and data visualization.
- `Data Analysis Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis Case Study.pptx`: A PowerPoint presentation that summarizes the findings of the analysis. It includes visualizations and dashboards that highlight key patterns and trends observed in the data.

## Tools Used

- **Python**: For data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis.
- **Tableau**: For creating interactive visualizations and dashboards

- ### Python Libraries
- `pandas`: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
